# Imagee Caption Generator

## CNN: 
- Convolutional Neural networks
- specialized deep neural networks that can process images as 2d matrices, used for image classification.

## LSTM
- Long short term memory
- type of recurrent neural network that is well suited for sequence predixction problems

## Image Caption Generator Model
- a CNN-RNN model using CNN and LSTM
    - CNN: used for extracting features from image
    - LSTM: used to generate description of image

## Usage
Run the following to apply the model on an image
```
 python3 testing_caption_generator.py -i "path-to-image/name-of-image-file.png"
```
